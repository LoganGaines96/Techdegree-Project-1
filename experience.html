      <h2> Why my passions are my passions</h2>
          <p>I find things that make my brain work. Something that keeps me going and driving forward. I have always been someone whos brain runs 24/7 365.</p>

      <h2>My passions and what they mean to me</h2>

          <p>Photography for its creative and sole singular person outlook on certain things whether it be landscapes, housing, portraits, and or products.</p>
          <p>Travel for the sheer aspect of being able to experience different langquages &amp; cultures. I don't want alot of money just no regrets &amp; head full of memories.</p>
          <p>Gaming always and will forever be a stressfull stress reliever for me. I know its a conundrum however. I will cherish every bit of gaming I ever do. It has helped me through alot.</p>
          <p>Coding last, but surely not least as a creative outlet that challenges me to learn and grow constantly.</p>
